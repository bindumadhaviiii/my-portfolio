                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>With a background in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE), I'm venturing into the world of software with a curious mind and a passion for innovation. My journey has been a blend of learning and experimentation, as I dive into coding projects that bridge the gap between hardware and software. As I develop skills in the computer field and work on mini projects, I find that my EEE background provides a solid foundation for tackling challenges in both domains. From circuits to code, I'm driven by the excitement of solving problems and making meaningful contributions to technology.</p>
